// Loopback predicates shared by the host halves of the DSH plugins.
//
// This fragment has ONE source of truth: dsh-mini-utility-dock/dist/loopback.js.
// DSH plugin host halves are plain Node ESM that each package ships standalone,
// so the fragment is embedded into `lib/shared.js` at build time by
//   npm run loopback:sync    (write it)
//   npm run loopback:check   (fail on drift)
// instead of being imported: a bare `import 'dsh-mini-utility-dock/...'` would
// put a runtime dependency on the dock into every plugin, and the whole point of
// the dock is that a plugin works with no sibling installed.
//
// Why it is shared at all: these predicates were copy-pasted per repo and
// drifted twice. The first drift rejected IPv6 loopback in all three plugins;
// the second made the three disagree on which Host spellings count as loopback
// (see scripts/guard-parity.mjs, which compares this block across repos).
//
// "Loopback" is decided in exactly one place — LOOPBACK_HOSTNAMES plus the
// IPv4-mapped IPv6 form of each entry — and both the name and the address
// predicate route through it, so the Host path and the peer path cannot drift
// apart again.
//
// Kept a separate fragment from the host guard on purpose: the predicates are
// stable facts about what an address is, while the guard is a policy about who
// may call an API. `dist/guard.js` imports this module, so the guard depends on
// this block and never the other way round.

// Hostnames a request to a loopback-bound API may legitimately arrive with.
// Exact spellings only: `api.localhost` and `127.0.0.1.evil.example` must stay
// rejected, which is what keeps DNS rebinding out of the API surface.

// put a runtime dependency on the dock into every plugin, and the whole point of
// the dock is that a plugin works with no sibling installed.
//
// This file is the POLICY half. What counts as loopback is a separate fragment
// (`dist/loopback.js`, embedded under the `dsh-loopback-helpers` marker), and
// this module uses the predicates that block exports in the same file rather than
// restating them: `hostHostname`, `isLoopbackName` and `isLoopbackAddress` are
// module-scope names here, declared by the block above. That keeps one copy of
// them in a consumer, and makes the dependency one-way and visible — `guard:sync`
// needs `loopback:sync` to have produced a `lib/shared.js` that declares them.
//
// There is deliberately no `import` here. A consumer embeds both blocks into one
// file, so an import of a sibling module would both break the standalone promise
// and collide with the exports the block above already declares.
//
// Why the guard is shared rather than reimplemented per plugin: the three plugins
// each carried their own `createGuard`, and the copies diverged three times. The
// parts that differed were never the *decisions* — they were the error codes and
// message strings welded into the same function, which forced every repo to keep
// its own copy and made drift possible. Here the enforcement order and every
// decision are fixed, and the wording is supplied as data by the caller
// (`policy`), so a plugin customizes its vocabulary without forking the logic.

// Default ports each scheme normalises away, so an Origin carrying no explicit
// port (for example `http://127.0.0.1`) compares equal to a server on 80/443.
// `new URL('http://127.0.0.1:80').port` is '', which compared unequal to "80"
// and turned a legitimate same-origin request into a rejection.

// The reasons this guard can reject. Each is a stable, guard-owned name for one
// decision; the *reason* is fixed here, while the machine-readable `code` a
// plugin's API exposes and the human wording are policy.
//
// An unidentifiable peer and an off-loopback peer are deliberately distinct
// decisions. Two plugins answer `non_loopback_peer` for both; one distinguishes
// them. Both distinctions are correct for their own API, and a plugin that
// collapses them names the same `code` for each — nothing widens either way,

 * Build the same-origin request guard for a loopback-bound API route.

 * Not exported under a plugin-facing name: each plugin publishes its own guard
 * bound to its own error vocabulary, so the name it exports — usually
 * `createGuard`, matching its previous API — is its own to declare. This is the
 * one factory every plugin calls.
 *
 * Enforces, in order: Fetch Metadata, an unparseable Host, the TCP peer address,
 * then the Host allowlist, then the Origin. Rejects by calling
 * `respond(res, 403, { ok: false, code, error })` and returning false; returns
 * true when the request may proceed.
 *
 * @param currentPort - the port this server listens on. A function is called per
 *   request so an Origin check follows a server whose port changes; a plain
 *   value is accepted for a fixed server.
 * @param respond - rejection sink, normally the plugin's `sendJson`. Kept
 *   injectable so tests can capture the rejection code instead of standing up a
 *   real ServerResponse.
 * @param allowRemoteHost - optional predicate. When it returns true, an
 *   off-loopback peer AND an off-loopback Host are admitted, because the caller
 *   has opted into verifying its own credential per request; the guard
 *   deliberately knows nothing about tokens. The Origin check still applies, so
 *   the exemption never widens the browser-facing boundary. A plugin that omits
 *   the predicate keeps absolute peer and Host criteria.
 * @param policy - optional per-reason `{ code, error }` overrides, keyed by
 *   `GUARD_REASONS`. A partial override merges with the default, so a plugin
 *   names only the reasons whose vocabulary differs. An unknown key throws: a
 *   typo would otherwise silently leave the default in place, and the plugin
 *   would expose a code no test expects.
